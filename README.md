# Trouble in the Workshop
An Interactive Fiction game that I wrote using the Inform 7 language and IDE. Since it's based on the language used by Infocom to create games such as Zork in 1980, the IDE publishes its files in various .blorb type files, such as .zblorb and .gblorb, which are game files from the old Z-machines. I'm honestly not even sure if it's possible to break those apart into a format that would be readable on Git, but I wanted to put it up here anyway in case you feel like downloading the file, firing up an old Z-machine interpreter, and giving it a go. :)
